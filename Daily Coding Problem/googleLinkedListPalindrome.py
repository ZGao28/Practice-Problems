# involves using an array to keep track of ordering of the original, and reversing the original in place
# a convoluted way that would take O(1) space is to keep a shortened hash of the linkedlist and also reversing in place.
# then traversing again and comparing with the hash again. This works because for it to be a palindrome it must be the same both ways.
